Deploying VirtualLeaf for Mac
1. Build the package: cd src; export QMAKESPEC=macx-g++; make;
2. Run "deploymodel.pl" as follows:
> cd ../bin; perl ../src/perl/deploymodel.pl VirtualLeaf
3. Run "macdeployqt" as follows
> macdeployqt VirtualLeaf.app
4. Build the installer using PackageMaker:
- cd ../src; open VirtualLeaf-install-macosx.pmdoc
- Under "Contents->VirtualLeaf, click on VirtualLeaf
- Choose tab "Components"
- Deselect "Allow relocation"
- Click "Build"

... I know it's quite a hassle, but if you follow these steps carefully the package and model plugins should work on a Mac without Qt installed... Good luck!
