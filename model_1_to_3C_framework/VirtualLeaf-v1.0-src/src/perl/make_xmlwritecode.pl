# Store essential model source code in XML files, so the exact model
# used for the geometry can be retrieved later on The crucial model
# description is in the files "reactions.h" (or similar) and leaf.cpp
# (or similar).

# First we should retrieve the name of the main code (i.e. leaf.cpp or
# so), and the version of reactions.h that we include there.

# We can get this from the project file (possibly called "LeafGrowth.pro")

# If more than one project file found, issue an error
