// horrendously confusing member function wrapper construct from VirtualLeaf's end users

// required format of flux_function is:
// double [model class name]::[function name](CellBase *this_cell, CellBase *adjacent_cell, Wall *w)
// e.g.:
// double MyModel::PINflux(CellBase *this_cell, CellBase *adjacent_cell, Wall *w)
